This is the document that has a lot of commonly used environments and notes. When you want to see how to type
them out, use ``Ctrl + Leftclick''. For the environment, most are typed out as: Environment, and their corresponding appearance. For example: \newpage
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{Le}{}{Label}
    This is the Lemma
\end{Le}
\end{verbatim}
\begin{Le}{}{Label}
    This is the Lemma
\end{Le}
